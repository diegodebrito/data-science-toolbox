# Data Science Toolbox


This folder contains procedures, classes and functions that I use frequently on my Data Science projects. The notebooks contain examples of applications. This is a permanent work in progress by definition.



# Contents


- [Reference Guide and Notes](https://github.com/diegodebrito/data-science-toolbox/blob/master/notes-reference.ipynb): notes on useful strategies and techniques for Data Science. The techniques described in this file are demonstrated on the individual notebooks. The purpose of this file is to have a quick reference guide for the contents of the other files.
- [Quick Baseline Analysis](https://github.com/diegodebrito/data-science-toolbox/blob/master/quick-baseline-workflow.ipynb): quick data cleaning and local validation with Random Forest model for first initial iteration.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/diegodebrito/data-science-toolbox/blob/master/eda.ipynb): mostly templates for different techniques/plots used on EDA. 
- [Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning](https://github.com/diegodebrito/data-science-toolbox/blob/master/model-selection-tuning.ipynb): model selection techniques and hyperparameter tuning strategis for Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- [Building Pipelines](https://github.com/diegodebrito/data-science-toolbox/blob/master/pipelines.ipynb): custom classes based on BaseEstimator (Scikit-Learn) and some pipelines templates for Machine Learning.
